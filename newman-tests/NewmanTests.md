# Newman Postman Collection Test Configuration

## Introduction

For more information on Newman Postman API testing , checkout the [Postman Sandbox API Reference](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/scripts/postman_sandbox_api_reference).

# Postman Collection JSON

At it's core, Newman executes a collection JSON that can either be generated by Postman's GUI or manually created JSON files that follow the same structure. In this collection, users can define global variables , pre-request scripts, and API calls to be executed in support of analyzing response JSON and other micro-service behavior.


# Configuration File JSON

Though the collection JSON can house all our tests and unique configurations, doing so would result in a massive file that is difficult to maintain. However, to add flexibility to your test environment Newman provides an option to specify a configuration JSON file as a flag during CLI execution. With this reference, users can specify, hosts, desired request bodies, and define the expected response from the API call for any given request.

Sample Command:
`newman run test.json  -d config.json`


Sample Config JSON:
```
[
  {
    "host": "127.0.0.1:8080",
    "testData": [
      {
        "testName": "checking checkDigt GET endpoint",
        "testNumber": 0,
        "expectedResponse": "The requested resource could not be found."
      },
      {
        "testName": "Check digit generation",
        "testNumber": 1,
        "requestBody": {
          "loanId": "10Bx939c5543TqA1144M999143X"
        },
        "expectedResponse": {
          "loanId": "10Bx939c5543TqA1144M999143X",
          "checkDigit": "38",
          "uli": "10Bx939c5543TqA1144M999143X38"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The structure/contents of your configuration file is limited only to it having to be valid JSON.

# Configuration Reference

In the collection JSON, this confiuration file can be referecned inside `exec` blocks using the `postman` library.

Example:
`"let testData = pm.iterationData.get(\"testData\")"`

The sample above will result in an array of objects mirrioring what was defined on the `testData` field of the configuration file.

# Variable Definition JSON

The following snippet reflects an example of how one would define a variable to be referenced globally in the collection JSON.

```
"variable": [{
    "key": "testNumber",
    "value": 0,
    "type": "int"
  },
  {
    "key": "requestBody",
    "value": "",
    "type": "string"
  }
],
```

# Pre-request  JSON

The following snippet reflects an example of how one would define a pre-request script. These scripts are executed before each API request. An example of their use can include setting up a request body variable before the next API test.

```
"event": [{
  "listen": "prerequest",
  "script": {
    "type": "text/javascript",
    "exec": [
      "testNumber = pm.variables.get(\"testNumber\");",
      "let testData = pm.iterationData.get(\"testData\")",
      "let requestBody = JSON.stringify(testData[testNumber].requestBody)",
      "++testNumber",
      "pm.variables.set(\"testNumber\",testNumber);",
      "pm.variables.set(\"requestBody\",requestBody);"
    ]
  }
}],
```

# Request & Post-Request  JSON

The following snippet reflects an example of how one would define a request/post-request script. In this case your API call is executed and you now have access to a response object and header for analysis.

```		
{
			"name": "POST- Check digit generation",
			"event": [{
				"listen": "test",
				"script": {
					"type": "text/javascript",
					"exec": [
						"pm.test(\"Status code is 200\",function () {",
						"      pm.response.to.have.status(200);",
						"});",
						"",
						"pm.test(\"CheckDigit Generation Validation\",function () {",
						"pm.expect(pm.response.text()).to.include(\"10Bx939c5543TqA1144M999143X38\");",
						"});"
					]
				}
			}],
			"request": {
				"method": "POST",
				"header": [{
					"key": "Content-Type",
					"value": "application/json"
				}],
				"body": {
					"mode": "raw",
					"raw": "{{requestBody}}"
				},
				"url": {
					"raw": "https://{{host}}checkDigit",
					"protocol": "https",
					"host": [
						"{{host}}"
					],
					"path": [
						"checkDigit"
					]
				}
			},
			"response": []
		}
```
